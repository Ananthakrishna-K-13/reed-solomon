# Reed-Solomon Error Correcting Code

This project implements the integer version of the Reed-Solomon error-correcting code in Python as part of the SM404 Number Theory assignment. The implementation can handle input messages with an upper bound $M = 10^{1000}$ . The python library [gmpy2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has been used to efficiently handle large numbers.
